This repo contains mathematical models and machine learning projects I created for exploration purposes.
The aapl_lstm.ipynb is a project to predict adjusted close price of apple stocks using an LSTM model which is attention added which allows for time based weighing of past data and leading to accurate results.
The modelling folder contains a project implementing a simple linear regression model for med_spread prediction. The logic behind the approach taken has been explained in the answers.txt file in the folder.
The forecasting using NNs file is a jupyter notebook with code that uses deep learning for WTI crude oil price prediction.
The randomwalk.py file is a simple monte carlo simulated random walks implementation.
The fbprophet file contains a simple multiseries forecasting example using fbprophet for different weather stations in China.
